# SpeechBrain-MOABB: Tutorials
## Introduction
Here we provide tutorials for introducing users to SpeechBrain-MOABB.

Specifically, we provide:
* Tutorial no. 1 **Setting up EEG decoding** (`tutorials/sbm_cli-part1.ipynb`). 
In this tutorial we provide a brief introduction of SpeechBrain-MOABB and of its first command-line interface. 
This interface allows users to run a full experiment on a target decoding problem (e.g., P300 decoding on a MOABB dataset) with known hyperparameters (i.e., no hyperparameter tuning is performed).
Models are trained and evaluated adopting a multi-seed initialization strategy, for providing performance estimates robust to fluctuations due to random initialization.
* Tutorial no. 2 **Setting up hyper-parameter tuning** (`tutorials/sbm_cli-part2.ipynb`).
This tutorial covers the second command-line interface of SpeechBrain-MOABB, devoted at performing multi-step hyperparameter tuning of the hyperparameters characterizing the entire decoding pipeline. 
Notably, the tuned hyperparameters can include both data pre-processing, network architecture, network training, and data augmentation steps of the deep learning-based EEG decoding pipeline. 
As for the previous command-line interface, here models are trained and evaluated adopting a multi-seed initialization strategy, for providing robust performance estimates.
* Tutorial no. 3 **Integrating braindecode models** (`tutorials/sbm_braindecode.ipynb`).
This tutorial shows how to use braindecode models in SpeechBrain-MOABB, designing a robust and comprehensive decoding pipeline with SpeechBrain-MOABB while taking advantage from the large set of models supported in braindecode.

Moreover, we also provide a tutorial for replicating the results reported in the paper associated to SpeechBrain-MOABB (`tutorials/sbm_results-paper.ipynb`), to ensure transparency of the results reported in the paper. 

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Quickstart
All tutorials were designed to run on Google Colaboratory using GPU. 
Users can copy and paste these tutorials in Google Colaboratory to use them.
